About this Exercise
This coding problem is intentionally very simple. 
We take for granted that you can decompose problems, devise algorithms, and write code. 
This exercise is more about conveying your individual coding style 
and how you deliver your work product to your teammates.

Problem
Given a JSON string which describes a menu, 
calculate the SUM of the IDs of all "items", 
as long as a "label" exists for that item.

Input
Your program should somehow take a file (or path to a file) as input:
Additional Instructions & Tips
1.	Post your solution to Github and make your code public so we can review. 
2.	Choose:
1.	Use whatever platform, tools, language(s) and coding environment you like.
2.	Command-line apps, Web apps, APIs, and fat-client solutions are all equally valid, so choose whatever you are most comfortable with (or whichever best showcases your talents)
3.	Write testable code and include tests in your solution
4.	Make sure your solution is easy to build, run, test, and deploy (instructions are always nice. TIP: Include a useful Readme)
